Let's step away from $\zeta$-function stuff for a bit, and talk about something different. [^1] In an [earlier post](../abs-val-p-adic), I mentioned these local fields like $\Q_p$ that are useful for studing things "one prime at a time" [^2] (whatever that means). Corresponding to this local fields, one also has global objects (e.g. $\Q$) from which they arise, but in some sense, these global objects (i.e. global fields) don't have all the information of the local objects readily available [^3]. Because of this, it may be nice to consider different global objects that combine all the local ones in a more straightforward manner.

# Definitions

Let $K$ be a global field. Technically, this means that $K$ is a number field or a function field of a curve over $\F_q$ (i.e. $K/\F_q(t)$ is finite), but the example I'll have in mind if os $K$ as a number field. At some point I may explicitly say to let $K$ be a number field to simplify things, but know that most (all?) of what I do can be done for a general global field. 

We want to construct the adele ring of $K$ which morally is just the topological ring

$$\prod_vK_v$$

where $v$ ranges over all places of $K$, and $K_v$ is the completion of $K$ at $v$. However, this product is stupid-big (so maybe not the easiest thing to work), and doesn't reflect some of the nice finiteness properties of global fields (e.g. the valuation of $x\in K$ is zero for almost all places). Because of this, we'll replace it with a so-called restricted product.

<div class="definition">
    Fix some set $I$ of indices, and some locally compact Hausdorff groups (or rings or fields) $G_i$ with compact open (hence closed (!)) subgroups $H_i\le G_i$. The <b>restricted (direct) product</b> of the $G_i$ with respect to the $H_i$ is
    $$\prodp_{i\in I}(G_i,H_i):=\bracks{(g_i)\in\prod_{i\in I}G_i:g_i\in H_i\text{ for all but finitely many }i}.$$
    We make this a topological group, but not by giving it the subspace topology it inherits from the direct product of the $G_i$. Instead, a neighborhood base of the identity consists of sets of the form $\prod N_i$ where $N_i$ is a neighborhood of $1\in G_i$ for all $i$, and $N_i=H_i$ for all but finitely many $i$.
</div>

Given this, we define the <b>finite adele ring of $K$</b> (or <b>ring of finite adeles</b>) to be the (topological) ring

$$\A_{K,\mrm{fin}}:=\prodp_{v\nmid\infty}(K_v,\ints v),$$

where the notation $v\nmid\infty$ means we're ranging only over finite (i.e. non-archimedean) places, and $\ints v\subset K_v$ is the ring of integers (i.e. elements of norm at most 1). The <b>adele ring of $K$</b> is obtained from the finite adeles by throwing in the infinite places. In other words, it is

$$\A_K:=\A_{K,\mrm{fin}}\by\prod_{v\mid\infty}K_v.$$

Since there are only finitely many infinite places [^4], if we let $\ints v=K_v$ for $v\mid\infty$, we could have just defined [^6]

$$\A_K=\prodp_v(K_v,\ints v).$$

Now, that we know what the adele ring is, a few remarks about why this restricted direct product is nicer than the ordinary direct product. First, topologically speaking, $\prod_vK_v$ is not locally compact [^5] essentially because the product topology requires open sets to be entire spaces in all but finitely many factors. However,$\dots$

<div class="proposition">
    Any restricted product
    $$\prodp_{i\in I}(G_i,H_i)$$
    is locally compact.
</div>
<div class="proof4">
    Let $S\subset I$ be finite, and consider the subgroup
    $$G_S=\prod_{v\in S}G_v\by\prod_{v\not\in s}H_v.$$
    Finite products of locally compact spaces are locally compact (and arbitrary products of compact spaces are compact), so $G_S$ is locally compact in the product topology. However, since $S$ is finite, the product topology on $G_S$ coincides with the subspace topology it inherits from the restricted direct product, so $G_S$ is locally compact there as well. Since every element of the restricted product belongs to a set of this form, it is locally compact.
</div>

This means that $\A_K$ is the product of finitely many locally compact spaces, so it is itself locally compact. In this way, it is not as stupid big as the ordinary direct product even though it looks massive at a glance. It's also worth noting that $K\into\A_K$ as a discrete subgroup via the diagonal (algebraic) embedding

$$x\mapsto(x,x,x,x,\cdots)$$

since $x$ has zero valuation at all but finitely many places [^7]. Elements of the image of this embedding are sometimes referred to as "principal adeles." The embedding $K\into\A_K$ should be thought of as an analouge of $\Z\into\R$ (e.g it's discrete [^8] and we'll later see that $\A_K/K$ is compact). The unit group $\units\A_K$ of the adele group is also important.

<div class="exercise">
    Prove that
    $$\units\A_K=\prod_{v\mid\infty}\units K_v\by\prodp_{v\nmid\infty}(\units K_v,\units{\ints v})$$
    as groups. The right hand side is denoted $\I_K$, and is called the <b>idele group of $K$</b>. It's topology as a restricted direct product is different (stronger) than its topology as a subgroup of $\A_K$.
</div>

We similarly have a diagonal embedding $\units K\into\I_K$. Finally, we can extend the absolute value $\nabs_v$ on $K_v$ to $\A_K$ via $\abs{x}_v=\abs{x_v}_v$ for $x\in\A_K$, and then we can combine these to define a global absolute value

$$\abs x=\prod_v\abs{x_v}_v$$

on $\A_K$ which converges since $\abs{x_v}_v\le1$ for all but finitely many $v$.

# Basic Properties

Let's prove some things about adeles.

<div class="theorem" name="Approximation Theorem">
    Fix a global field $K$. Let $\A_\omega=\prod_{v\mid\infty}K_v\by\prod_{v\nmid\infty}\ints v$. Then, 
    $$\A_K=K+\A_\omega\text{, and }K\cap\A_\omega=\ints K$$ 
    where $\ints K$ is the ring of integers of $K$ (elements with absolute value $\le1$ at all places).
</div> 
<div class="proof4">
    Here, $K$ is embedded diagonally into $\A_K$. We want to show that given any $x\in\A_K$, there's some $\mu\in K$ such that each component of the difference $x-\mu$ is a local integer. Let $\mfp\subset\ints K$ be prime, and write $\mfp\cap F=(p)$ where $F\subseteq K$ is $\Z$ or $\F_q[t]$. Then, multiplying by $p$ will reduce the $\mfp$-adic absolute value of $x$. Since $\abs x_v\le1$ for all but finitely many places, this means that there's some $m\in F$ such that $mx$ is integral at all finite primes. Let $\{\mfp_1,\dots,\mfp_r\}$ be the set of primes of $K$ (i.e. prime ideals of $\ints K$) that divide (i.e. contain) $m$, and let $n_1,\dots,n_r$ be naturals such that $\mfp_j^{n_j}\nmid(m)$ (i.e. $n_j>v_{\mfp_j}(m)$), then the Chinese remainder theorem let's us find some $\lambda\in\ints K$ such that
    $$\lambda\equiv mx_j\pmod{\mfp_j^{n_j}},$$
    where $x_j$ is the component of the adele $x$ corresponding to $\mfp_j$. Let $\mu=\lambda/m$, and note that $x-\mu=\inv m(mx-\lambda)$ is integral at each of the primes $\mfp_j$ (since we chose $n_j$ large). At other primes, its absolute value is the same as $mx-\lambda$'s so it's integral everywhere. Hence, we win.
</div>
One can also proove
<div class="theorem" name="Strong Approximation">
    Fix a finite place $v_0$ on a global field $K$, and let $\A_{K,v_0}=\prodp_{v\neq v_0}(K_v,\ints v)$ where $v$ ranges over all finite places. Then, $K$ is dense in $\A_{K,v_0}$.
</div>
but doing so requires saying the words "Haar measure," and I'd rather not get into that, so I'll skip the proof of this fact [^9]. If you recall from before, $K$ is discrete in $\A_K$, and so certainly not dense. This results says that if we remove a single (finite) place from $\A_K$, then $K$ goes from being discrete to being dense!
<div class="remark">
    For an arbitrary Dedekind domain $A$, the <b>weak approximation theorem</b> says that for any finite set of primes $\mfp_i$ along with integers $e_i\ge0$, there exists some $a\in A$ such that $v_{\mfp_i}(a)=e_i$ for all $i$. Here, $v_{\mfp_i}$ is the $\mfp_i$-adic valuation. Sincr rings of integers of global fields are Dedekind domains, you may want to take a minute to think about how strong approximation compares/relates to weak approximation.
</div>

We'll next take a look at how $\A_E$ is related to $\A_K$ when $E/K$ is a(n) (finite) extension of global fields.

# Riemann-Roch for Curves Over a Finite Field

[^1]: Secretly, we're not stepping that far away from it. One does Fourier analysis on R to prove nice things (i.e. existence of a functional equation) about the Riemann zeta function. Analagously, one does Fourier analysis on these adelic rings to prove nice things about more general L-functions. We won't really touch on this here, but it's lurking in the background.
[^2]: Better put, "one place at a time"
[^3]: Of course, given e.g. Q, you can complete it at various places to obtain all the Q_p's you could want. However, if you want to study e.g. Q_2 and Q_5 at the same time, then you can't complete Q because this will kill valuable information, but Q itself is somehow not the best place to work to understand Q_2 and Q_5 simultaneously. 
[^4]: Exercise: prove this (hint: infinite places on number fields come from embeddings into C)
[^5]: You want this to be able to do analysis-y type stuff. Locally compact topolgical groups have Haar measures which let you do Fourier Analysis (I guess in this setting it's typically called harmonic analysis) on them (maybe just when they're abelian).
[^6]: If we did this, we would need to amend our definition of restricted products to not require all H_i to be compact. Instead, we'd only require all but finitely many H_i are compact. I'll leave it up to the reader to figure out how to modify arguments for this slightly more general definition.
[^7]: Exercise: prove this (hint: for $K$ a number field, look at denominators)
[^8]: Exercise: prove this (hint: suffices to find a neighborhood around 1 containing no other principal adele) (hint2: It's possible you want to hold off on proving this until you see the product formula)
[^9]: I don't think I'll need it for anything. If I do and it bothers you that I haven't proved it, you can find a proof in [these notes](http://math.mit.edu/classes/18.785/2017fa/LectureNotes25.pdf)
