I talked a little bit about the topic of this post's title in a [recent post](../comm-alg), but I want to stress that this [duality between algebra and geometry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mYLi3PGOc) goes beyond [^1] this $\spec$ business. In particular, I'm going to discuss a more "topological" setting where we see nice interplay between algebra and geometry [^2]: relating a (compact, Hausdorff) topological space to its ring of (real-valued) continuous functions.

# Prelim on Separation Axioms

This might just be because there's no point-set topology class at my school [^3], but I get the sense that too many people don't know about the theory of separation axioms for topological spaces. Sadly, I do not think I have enough space in this post to develop this theory, but I can state some needed highlights. 

# $X``=" C^0(X)$

# Swan's Theorem

[^1]: I don't actually know that much about this area, so maybe what I'm gonna talk about in this post is somehow the same as this $\spec$ stuff. That would surprise me though.
[^2]: It really bothers me that topology and geometry are very similar in general character, but the only word I know for capturing both of them at once is "geometry". Like, sometimes I say "geometry" and mean "topology/geometry" but other times I say it and mean just "geometry". How's anyone supposed to understand what I'm saying?
[^3]: Which is really a shame
