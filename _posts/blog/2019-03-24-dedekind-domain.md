I wanna try something different with this post (skip this paragraph to get right into the math). As a general rule of thumb, I usually try to keep this blog mostly self-contained [^1]. At the very least, before getting to the main topic of a post, I try to cover a technically sufficient amount of background material either in the beginning of the post or in previous posts. However, I'm not sure how sustainable this is. I try to cut corners when I can, but it's still starting to feel like my backlog of things I want to talk about is growing much faster than I would like. For example, I've wanted to write this post for almost two years now, but doing so "properly" would require me first doing a primer post on the relevant commutative algebra.

[^1]: Modulo some basics I've vowed to never blog about like linear algebra and point-set topology.
