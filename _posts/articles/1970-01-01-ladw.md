title: "Linear Algebra Done Wrong"
categories: articles

author: Sergei Treil
description: This was the first textbook I every successfully self-studied, and my introduction to more abstract mathematics. I'd reccomend it as a good book for anyone willing to learn linear algebra, but be warned that some familiarity with the subject (e.g. knowing what a matrix is or knowing that arrows are vectors) will definetly help. The first page states the axioms of a vector space.
