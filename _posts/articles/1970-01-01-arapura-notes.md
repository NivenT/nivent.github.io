description: This book is a great introduction to complex (algebraic) geometry. It begins by developing the theory of sheaves and their cohomology, using de Rham cohomology and Riemann surfaces as good examples for applying this theory. After that, it looks at Hodge Theory and many facets of complex geometry. It's lacking in examples (which many math texts are) but it's mostly user-friendly. Shameless self-plug, I wrote some notes (https://github.com/NivenT/Arapura_Notes) on parts of this book.
