title: "Quantum Computing Since Democritus"
categories: articles

author: Scott Aaronson
description: This is a hard book to describe, but easy one to want to recommend. It talks about a lot of topics (set theory, logic, computatibility, physics, etc.) in a very casual but engaging manner. It's also the only book I've ever read more than once.
