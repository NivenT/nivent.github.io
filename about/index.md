I am a student at Stanford University hoping to become a computer scientist/mathematician. This website is a place for me to talk about interesting topics I come across and motivation for me to learn web development.

Currently, I am developing this site under the assumption that my audience is essentially nonexistent, so the posts are all hurried and likely to contain many errors. Unless I start to get the impression that people actually read this blog, I will not be fixing those mistakes.
